# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `socketUrl` is now normalized to `sseUrl` when the active endpoint is absent.
- Custom integration options use `extensions: Record<string, unknown>` instead of arbitrary top-level keys.
- `FloatingButtonProps` exposes the complete `ChatProps` pass-through contract.

### Deprecated

- `socketUrl`, `socketPath`, `enableSSE`, `reconnectAttempts`, and `reconnectDelay` remain source-compatible but are documented
  as legacy options. Use `sseUrl` for the complete stream endpoint.

// Old Rasa-web
window.WebChat.default({
  socketUrl: "http://rasa:5005",
});

// New WebChat
