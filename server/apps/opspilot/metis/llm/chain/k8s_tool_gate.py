"""K8s report-tool gating (F058).

Two report-rendering tools are K8s-specific:

- ``report_config_diff``     (built by ``ToolsNodes._build_diff_report_tool``)
- ``generate_repair_report`` (built by ``ToolsNodes._build_bulk_repair_tool``)

Historically these were bound to *every* agent that had any tools at all, even
agents whose tool pool has nothing to do with Kubernetes. The frontend only
renders the ``config_diff_report`` / repair-report events when present, so an
agent that never deals with K8s carrying these tools is pure overhead (extra
tool schema in every LLM call, extra surface for the model to misfire on).

This module isolates the *decision* of whether an agent is "K8s-flavoured" so
that the DeepAgent tool assembly can gate the two report tools behind it. The
decision is intentionally based on the agent's actual tool pool rather than on
the request's ``tools_servers`` list, because:

* the production K8s tool servers (``langchain:kubernetes`` /
  ``langchain:kubernetes_data_collection``) load tools whose names contain
  ``kubernetes`` and/or the config-analysis trigger
  ``analyze_deployment_configurations``; and
* focused tests can drive the tool pool directly with
  ``node_builder.tools = [analyze_deployment_configurations]`` without calling
  ``setup()``/populating ``tools_servers``.

Keying off tool *names* keeps both paths working.
