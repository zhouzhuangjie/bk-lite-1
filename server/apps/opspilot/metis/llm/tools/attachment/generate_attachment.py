    """Generate a downloadable file attachment and return its download URL.

    **IMPORTANT: You MUST call this tool whenever the user asks to generate, create, produce,
    save, or export any file, document, report, or attachment — regardless of file format.**

    Do NOT output file content as plain text in your response. Always use this tool so the
    user receives a downloadable file. After calling this tool, briefly summarize what was
    generated. Do NOT paste the download URL, file:// links, /api/proxy paths, or placeholder
    tokens such as "加密token" into the chat or the file body; the UI renders the download button.

    When to call this tool:
    - User says "generate a report / create a file / export data / save as PDF" etc.
    - User wants any content delivered as a downloadable file rather than inline text.

    Parameters:
    - filename: Desired file name including extension (e.g. "report.md", "data.xlsx").
    - content:  Complete file content to save. For xlsx/csv pass raw data; for md/txt/pdf
                pass the full Markdown or plain-text body.
    - file_type: File format — "md", "pdf", "xlsx", "docx", "txt", "csv", "html", etc.
                 Defaults to "md" (Markdown).
    - title:    Optional document title used as a header in PDF/Word output.
